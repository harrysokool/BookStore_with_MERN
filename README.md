# BookStore_with_MERN

Hi, I am trying to learn MERN stack and I think the best way to learn these technologies are to build a project. This repo will be my version control for this mini MERN stack project.

In this project, I used MongoDB, Express js for the backend and I used react js for the frontend, I used vite to make the frontend environment.

To setup the project:
1) npm init -y
-> this is for adding a package.json to the project

2) npm install express nodemon
-> this is to install the packages

3) then make a folder (index.js) in the backend file

To run the program, type in npm run dev.
