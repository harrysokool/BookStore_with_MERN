# BookStore_with_MERN

Hi, I am trying to learn MERN stack and I think the best way to learn these technologies are to build a project. This repo will be my version control for this mini MERN stack project.

In this project, I used MongoDB, Express js for the backend and I used react js for the frontend, I used vite to make the frontend environment.
